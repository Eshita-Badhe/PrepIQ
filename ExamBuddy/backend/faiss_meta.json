Hathway ISP Data Breach (2024)\nIn March 2024, Hathway, a leading Indian Internet Service Provider (ISP) and cable operator, experienced a major security breach. The personal information of over 41.5 million customers was compromised. The attackers accessed and leaked approximately 200GB of highly sensitive user data. This included customer names, email addresses, phone numbers, residential addresses, account credentials, and subscription and billing details.\nCause: The breach resulted from the exploitation of a critical vulnerability in Hathway’s content management system (CMS). This incident highlighted deficiencies in Hathway’s digital security, especially in web application security practices and CMS maintenance.\nRecovery: Fixing the vulnerability in the CMS.\nInvestigating the breach and securing systems.\nAlerting affected customers and taking safety steps.\nImproving overall digital security after the incident."}, {"id": "97ad0435-9034-4d5b-9d64-a6f127ef2796", "username": "Eshita_Badhe", "folder_title": "Cyber_Security", "doc_path": "uploaded/Eshita_Badhe/Cyber_Security/Activity1 - Cyber Crimes Case Study Analysis.pdf", "section_title": "Precaution (Prevention Methods):", "chunk_index": 1, "content": "Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments of web\napplications and CMS to detect and fix security flaws.\nAdopt robust encryption standards and enforce strict access control\nmeasures to protect sensitive customer data. Implement continuous monitoring and threat detection to identify and stop unauthorized intrusions or unusual data access.\n2. AIIMS Ransomware Attack\nThe All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi was hit by a cyber-attack late last year which forced the medical institution to switch to a manual mode of operations. The ransomware attack, like many others, targeted the organization’s sensitive data, including patient records, research data, and administrative information.\nCause: The attackers, in this case the LockBit ransomware gang, allegedly demanded approximately Rs 200 crore (which is about $24.5 million) in cryptocurrency from the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences. It must be noted that the AIIMS server was down for six days in a row as a result of the attack.\nRecovery: The AIIMS cyber-attack posed a major risk to patient confidentiality. But more significantly, it caused serious disruptions to the delivery of medical services. With critical systems affected, AIIMS faced challenges in providing timely healthcare services to patients, potentially compromising their well-being. The AIIMS incident garnered widespread media attention and raised alarm bells around global security practices. But more importantly, it was a wake-up call for several similarly sized government-run organizations in India and healthcare providers the world over.\nPrecaution: This is why it’s imperative to take a hard look at your Ransomware Readiness and Ransomware Mitigation Plans. It may, therefore, be a good idea to hire cybersecurity specialists through cost-effective services such as the Virtual Cyber Assistant service. The virtual cybersecurity experts can help you evaluate your cybersecurity posture and help you build defenses against crippling ransomware attacks. They can also help you conduct Ransomware Tabletop exercises that can show you how well your management & Incident Response teams are equipped to handle a real attack.\n3. Hacktivist DDoS Attacks on Indian Organizations\nIn 2025, over 100 Indian organizations across sectors such as government, education, finance, telecom, defense, and healthcare were targeted by Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks launched by hacktivist groups. These attacks aimed to disrupt services and protest against Indian government policies, especially during heightened tensions with Pakistan. Although no sensitive data was stolen, the attacks caused service disruptions and exposed weaknesses in digital infrastructure.\nCause: The attacks were politically motivated, intended to draw attention to political issues. Hacktivist groups from Southeast Asia, including names like AnonSec, RipperSec, Dark Storm Team, and Keymous+, used DDoS tools to overwhelm Indian servers. The groups exploited poor DDoS protection and targeted systems with high volumes of traffic to knock them offline.\nRecovery: Most affected organizations detected the attacks quickly through traffic analysis and implemented mitigation strategies such as using firewalls, honeypots, and cloud-based DDoS protection. Some state cyber cells, like Maharashtra’s, deployed advanced techniques to neutralize the threats. Although the outages were disruptive, most lasted only a few minutes, and no data loss or internal compromise occurred."}, {"id": "d4cdd8fa-54d5-4d60-841a-78f7eb10c21e", "username": "Eshita_Badhe", "folder_title": "Cyber_Security", "doc_path": "uploaded/Eshita_Badhe/Cyber_Security/Activity1 - Cyber Crimes Case Study Analysis.pdf", "section_title": "Improve DDoS protection with multi-layered security systems.", "chunk_index": 2, "content": "Enable real-time traffic monitoring and alerts to detect sudden traffic"}, {"id": "7e31723c-5f25-460f-ba36-b0c269c7dbe7", "username": "Eshita_Badhe", "folder_title": "Cyber_Security", "doc_path": "uploaded/Eshita_Badhe/Cyber_Security/Activity1 - Cyber Crimes Case Study Analysis.pdf", "section_title": "spikes.", "chunk_index": 3, "content": "Use firewalls, honeypots, and regular patching to strengthen defenses.\nConduct geopolitical threat intelligence to anticipate politically motivated"}, {"id": "17700110-d9d0-4de6-8a2f-4bb062f552e5", "username": "Eshita_Badhe", "folder_title": "Cyber_Security", "doc_path": "uploaded/Eshita_Badhe/Cyber_Security/Activity1 - Cyber Crimes Case Study Analysis.pdf", "section_title": "attacks.", "chunk_index": 4, "content": "Train incident response teams and conduct regular cyber drills.\n4.
